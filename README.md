# DNA Translation Repository

## Overview
This repository contains a Python module designed for the simulation of various genetic processes, including DNA replication, transcription, and the translation of RNA into protein sequences. It's a tool for students, educators, and researchers interested in computational biology and genetics.

## Features
- **DNA Replication**: Generate a complementary DNA strand from a given DNA sequence.
- **Transcription**: Identify transcription regions in DNA and transcribe them to RNA.
- **Translation**: Translate RNA sequences into protein chains based on codon mappings.
- **Reverse Transcription**: Convert RNA back to DNA.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
You need Python 3 installed on your system to use these scripts.

### Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine using:

`git clone https://github.com/subashini-22/dna-translation.git`

### Usage
Each function in the script can be used independently based on your computational biology needs. Import the functions from the script and use them in your own
