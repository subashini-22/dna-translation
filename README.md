# DNA Translation Repository

## Overview
This repository hosts a Python module developed as part of an introductory programming course at the National University of Singapore (NUS). The module simulates various genetic processes such as DNA replication, transcription, and the translation of RNA into protein sequences.

## Features
- **DNA Replication**: Generate a complementary DNA strand in the 5' to 3' direction from a given DNA sequence, also in the 5' to 3' direction.
- **Transcription**: Identify transcription regions in DNA and transcribe them to RNA.
- **Reverse Transcription**: Convert RNA back to DNA.
- **Translation**: Translate RNA sequences into protein chains based on codon mappings.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
You need Python 3 installed on your system to use these scripts.

### Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine using:

`git clone https://github.com/subashini-22/dna-translation.git`

### Usage
Each function in the script can be used independently based on your computational biology needs. Import the functions from the script and use them in your own
